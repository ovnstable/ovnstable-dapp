  "aboutText": "The exchange-traded strategy USD+/WMATIC ($USD+WMATIC), is an ERC-20 structured product built on Polygon that lets you leverage a collateralized debt position (USDC lent on AAVE) to borrow a volatile asset (WMATIC), pair it with USD+ stablecoin, and provide USD+/WMATIC liquidity on Dystopia / Penrose all in one action. This allows earning high APY and hedging against WMATIC volatility.<br/><br/>The unique feature of USD+/WMATIC ETS is that it automatically administers a health factor of 1.20x on AAVE and rebalances your Lent/Borrowed amounts to maintain a stringent 1.20x Health Factor. Payouts are happening every day and are auto compounded back into the strategy to further amplify rewards.<br/><br/>Users also benefit from minimal gas costs associated with minting, redeeming, and all other DeFi activities because this product is deployed on Polygon - a highly scalable L2 chain.",
  "riskText": "By depositing USD+ into this strategy, you automatically borrow WMATIC from AAVE v3 at a market rate.<br/><br/>The strategy's smart contract is designed to automatically invest these equal values of WMATIC and USD+ into Dystopia's USD+/WMATIC Liquidity Pool, after which these LP Tokens are staked into the Gauge Pool on Penrose.",
  "impermanentText": "Due to trading activities with the USD+/WMATIC pair on Dystopia and/or WMATIC price change, the pool may become imbalanced, which can cause rebalance of a user’s LP position, resulting in increased or decreased number of WMATIC vs. borrowed in a position. When a user withdraws their investment, the strategy's smart contract may need to use a user's funds to buy additional WMATIC to repay the lent amount (plus interest), which can result in a net loss from the initial deposit.",
  "ammText": "The strategy's smart contract automatically moves your deposit into the said Automated Market Maker (i.e., Dystopia) and, in doing so, may incur an AMM’s smart contract risk.<br/><br/>By depositing funds into this smart contract, a user understands and agrees to the strategies to which it will invest underlying assets.",
  "importantText": "Yield/APY is not guaranteed and can be highly variable depending on the volume and rewards from the underlying AMM as well as the price of a volatile asset (WMATIC). Farmers may incur net losses if the impermanent loss is more significant than the yield earned."
